                <p>Hello! My name is Brianna and I am a Fullstack Software Developer. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I wanted to use all of that newly acquired free time to develope a new skill. After obsessing over the static html pages I was able to make based on what I had taught myself, I decided I needed to know more. Thats when I enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program and fell in love with coding. I'm extremely passionate about the chance to constantly expand and develop new skills in this ever growing industry. My overwhelming desire to understand the problem in-front of me creates a strong work ethic and motivates me to give it my all, not only in the work-place, but in everything that I do.</p>
